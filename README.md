A compendium module for FFXIV TTRPG that includes some of the content available in the Core Rulebook. This is intended to be used with [Valmyrr's FFXIV TTRPG Custom System](https://github.com/Valamyrr/FFxivTTRPG)

This module is built to support the images supplied by the [image pack](https://github.com/AxeBane/ffxiv-ttrpg-icons-pack) module, however you are welcome to use your own instead.

* Custom Ability Tags: ``CHANGEME,Physical,Ranged,Magic,Unique,Primary,Secondary,Instant,Invoked,Gem,Wind-Aspected,Fire-Aspected,Earth-Aspected,Water-Aspected,Lightning-Aspected,Ice-Aspected,Thunder Spell,Flurry,Poison,Song,Ninjutsu,Technique,Pet,Limit Break``
